# Matching Coco
This is my very first Swift project. It is a matching game I made in 8th grade following a [tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRqhzcHGw1YdahNsCLZdSVfNv0stwvdx) on YouTube. At the time, my cousin and I ran an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/lilcoco_pebbles/) for my cousin's dog, Coco, where we posted cute pictures of her and I made music out of her barks using GarageBand.
