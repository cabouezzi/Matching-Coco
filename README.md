# Matching Coco

This is my very first Swift project. It is a matching game I made in 8th grade following a [tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMRqhzcHGw1YdahNsCLZdSVfNv0stwvdx) on YouTube. About a year later, my cousin and I ran an [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/lilcoco_pebbles/) for my cousin's dog, Coco, where we posted cute pictures of her and I made music out of her barks using GarageBand. I then modified the project to be a feature of the account, including a unique theme song on the home screen and pictures of Coco on the game cards.
